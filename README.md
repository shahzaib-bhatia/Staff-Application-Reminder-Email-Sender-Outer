# Staff-Application-Reminder-Email-Sender-Outer

A volunteer organization uses google forms and spreadsheets to manage volunteer signups. It is generally a cumbersome process that has been smoothed by the HR department's forms wizardry. Unfortunately, acting within forms can only accomplish so much.

This is a google appscript project that runs on a schedule and sends out reminders to department leaders that they may have applications that require action. It also sends them their current staff list.

I do not claim to be a competent js devloper but it runs and generates emails.
